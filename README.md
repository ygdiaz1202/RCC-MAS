RCC-MAS a new algorithm for computing all the rough-set-constructs The core concept of our proposed algorithm revolves around a recursive ap- proach 
that systematically reduces the search space in each iteration. By leveraging information from the previous iterations, our algorithm aims con- sider
only those attributes necessary to compute all constructs. We hereafter refer to our algorithm as “Recursive Construct Computation via Minimal Set of 
Attributes (RCC-MAS )”. The recursive nature of RCC-MAS allows for a systematic exploration of the attribute combinations, gradually narrowing down the 
search space with each iteration. This approach improves the computational efficiency while ensure that all constructs are computed. Through experimental
evaluations over standard public datasets, we show the superiority of RCC-MAS regarding using the most efficient algorithms for computing reducts or irreducible 
testors but for computing constructs in terms of time and number of evaluated candidates. Our algorithm represents a step forward that allows a more efficient
and practical exploration of the subset of candidate attributes for construct computation
